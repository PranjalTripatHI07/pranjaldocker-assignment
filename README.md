# Docker Assignment 2024 âœ¨

Welcome to the **Docker Assignment 2024**! This repository demonstrates my understanding and practical usage of Docker technology, showcasing how containerization can enhance development workflows and simplify application deployment.


## Overview

Docker is a powerful tool for developers, enabling the creation, deployment, and management of applications inside containers. It isolates applications and their dependencies, ensuring they run consistently across various environments. This assignment explores the use of Docker to containerize applications and demonstrates the benefits of containerization in both development and production scenarios.

In this project, I will be demonstrating how to create a simple application, containerize it using Docker, and utilize Docker Compose for multi-container management. 

## Objective

The objectives of this assignment are:

- To demonstrate proficiency in Docker, including creating Docker images, managing containers, and understanding container lifecycle.
- To learn and implement Docker Compose to orchestrate multiple containers.
- To showcase the efficiency and portability of Docker containers in a real-world application deployment.
